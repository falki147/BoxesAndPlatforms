In this third-person 3D platformer game, the objective is to collect as many
diamonds as possible while reaching the end. However, be cautious of dangerous
obstacles such as spikes and enemies that you must avoid along the way. The
game consists of four different levels to play through.

Developed in 2016 as a school project, this game was written in C# using SDL2,
OpenGL, and the Bullet physics engine.

## Controls
Use the keys 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' to move in different directions, and press
the 'space' bar to jump.
